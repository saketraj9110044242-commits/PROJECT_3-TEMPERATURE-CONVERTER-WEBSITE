# Project Overview: Temperature Converter Website
Objective

The goal of this project is to create a Temperature Converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will allow users to input a temperature in one scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and convert it to other scales.

# Key Features
-> Input Field:


*Allows the user to enter a temperature value.

-> Dropdown Menus:

*Users can select the input temperature scale (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).

*Users can choose the desired output temperature scale.

-> Convert Button:

*On clicking, it triggers the conversion process and displays the result.

-> Result Display:

*Shows the converted temperature value dynamically.

# Technologies Used
-> HTML:

-> Structures the layout of the page.

-> Provides input fields, dropdowns, and buttons.

# CSS:

-> Enhances the visual design with styling for inputs, buttons, and layouts.

-> JavaScript:

-> Implements the logic to convert temperatures between different scales.

-> Handles user interactions and updates the result dynamically.

# Project Workflow
-> Planning

*Define the user interface layout (input field, dropdowns, and button).

*Decide on the conversion formulas for temperature scales.

-> Development

*Create the page structure with HTML.

*Style the page using CSS to make it user-friendly.

*Write JavaScript for temperature conversion logic and user interaction.

->Testing

*Test all possible conversions (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Kelvin to Celsius).

*Ensure the app works seamlessly on different devices and browsers.

-> Deployment

*Host the website using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.


# Potential Challenges
-> Handling invalid inputs like text instead of numbers.

-> Ensuring the interface is intuitive and easy to use.
